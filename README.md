Outside resources used: Besides the occasional w3 schools search, every google search didnt come up with what I needed. Everytime I thought I was stuck I went back to the lectures and almost always found my answer.

Problems with the assignment: Because I was behind in the course, this was challening to get started. The concept of javascript language is a little difficult for me to formulate what I want to do. But this assignment really helped me understand it more and put it into practical practice.

Thank you for an amazing semester and I do apologize for being behind at times. You were very understand and more then accomidating. Thank you so much!
